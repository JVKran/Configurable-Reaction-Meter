# US/OS-II Based
This folder implements a response time meter that's completely based upon an RTOS that's running on a custom NIOS-II softcore.

## Structure
This implementation can be seen as a basic microcontroller with code; the microcontroller contains a CPU, Memory and peripherals. On this microcontroller, one is able to run code. This code uses a Board-Support Package (BSP) that's automically generated by Intels Embedded Design Suite (EDS). This BSP can be used to use the present peripherals, such as the Parallel Input Output (PIO) core, Interval Timer and (custom) Seven Segment Driver. The code consists of one US/OS-II Task with a state machine.
